# Summary of Program Functions

Parcels of varying sizes and colours are randomized and move along an animated conveyor belt. Upon reaching a scanner, a light will indicate that the box is being sorted. According to the colour of the parcel (which represents whether it is an "international", "domestic" or "unknown" parcel), it will continue along the one of the three conveyor belts which correspond to the correct parcel type. An image is displayed upon scanning representing what type of parcel was scanned. The spacebar can be clicked in order to stop only the conveyor belt that feeds the parcels in, but not the three conveyor belts after sorting, which only move while a parcel is feeded to it.
